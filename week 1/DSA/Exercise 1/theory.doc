     a)  -Data structures help in organizing and storing large amounts of data in such a way so that we can access them easily when required.
         -A well-designed system can handle increasing amounts of data without a proportional increase in resource consumption.

     b) -ArrayList: Used for storing ordered list of products.
        -HashMap: Provides key-value pairs.It will help to find any products based on product ID.
        -Binary Search Tree: takes care of sorted lists of products,allowing O(log n) time complexity for search,insert and delete.

     a) Add Product- O(1) due to put operation in  hash map.
        Update Product- O(1) due to put operation in hash map.
        Delete Product- O(1) using remove operation has average time complexity of O(1).
     


     b) We can Optimize the Operation by:
           -Caching mechanism
           -Load balancing

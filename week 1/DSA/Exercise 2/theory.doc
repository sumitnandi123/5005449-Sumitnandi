  a) -Big O notation is used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's running time or space in worst case.

     -it helps in analyzing algorithm's efficiency and scalability.it also helps us to compare diffrent algorithms and choose the most efficient amongst them.

  b) -Best case :-  The case where the algorithm performs the fewest operations. For search operations this  means finding the target element at the first position.
     
    -Average Case:- The case representing the expected running time of an algorithm over certain inputs.

    -Worst case :-  The scenario where the algorithm performs the maximum number of operations. For search operations this means the target element is not in the list or is at the last
                     of the list.
